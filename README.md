# Acharya-JavaProgramming

This repo contains contributions to project Acharya, an Open Smart Education Initiative. Submissions in the domain of Java programming  are welcome.  You are contributions will be made available in the Acharya E-Learning platform.



# How to make Contributions

You can submit Jupyter notebooks that illustrates the working of java programs. Please check the topics to be covered. However, you do not have to restrict the submissions to the list of topics to be covered. Make sure to include figures and videos in your notebook.

For those who are confused as to how jupyter notebooks are possible for c and c++, please refer to jupyter-IJava/scijava, which is a jupyter kernel for c/c++.

If you have miniconda installed, do the following:
```
conda create ijava
conda activate ijava
```

After this, you'd be with a totally new env just for java notebooks called ijava. To install the required kernel, in this new env:

To install this package with conda run one of the following:
```
conda install -c conda-forge scijava-jupyter-kernel
conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf201901 scijava-jupyter-kernel
conda install -c conda-forge/label/cf202003 scijava-jupyter-kernel
```

Now you have a jupyter notebook kernel that can handle java code.
